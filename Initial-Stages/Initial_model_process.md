### Key Steps and Methods:

1. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Categorical variables were encoded using **one-hot encoding** to convert them into numerical format suitable for the models.
   - Continuous variables (such as *Hours_Studied*, *Attendance*, etc.) underwent different transformation methods (e.g., **logarithmic**, **square root**, and **Box-Cox**) to improve model fit, stabilize variance, and reduce skewness.

2. **Transformation of Predictors**:
   - Both the predictors and the target variable *Exam_Score* were transformed using various techniques to satisfy the assumptions of the linear regression model. Each transformation aimed to improve data normality and reduce skewness to enhance model accuracy.

3. **Multiple Linear Regression**:
   - A **Ordinary Least Squares (OLS)** regression was performed on standardized predictors, calculating key statistics such as **R-squared**, **adjusted R-squared**, **p-values**, and **Variance Inflation Factor (VIF)** to assess multicollinearity between variables.

4. **ANOVA (Analysis of Variance)**:
   - **Type 1 and Type 2 ANOVA** were used to analyze the model, assessing the statistical significance of each predictor. ANOVA helped to measure the individual and joint effects of predictors on the target variable.
   - Key metrics, such as **Sum of Squares (SS)**, **F-statistic**, and **p-values**, were reported and summarized in a table for better insight.

5. **Ranking by Importance**:
   - Predictors were ranked by **Sum of Squares** from **Type 2 ANOVA**, revealing their relative importance in explaining the variance in exam scores.
